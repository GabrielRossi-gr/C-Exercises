#  The purpose of this repository is to report my evolution in the C language.
 
   I had contact with C for the first time in college, I put each exercise inside a folder named with the date to be able to observe my evolution accurately, not all folders are projects, many of them contain code drafts and may have semantics and syntax errors .
