#  The purpose of this repository is to report my evolution in the C language.
 
   I had contact with C for the first time in college, I put each exercise inside a folder named with the date, to be able to observe my evolution with precision, not all folders are projects, many of them contain code drafts and may have semantic and syntax errors.
